The goal for this application is to quickly calculate how close you are to your weight goal. There is only one screen, the idea is to make it super friendly and very helpful to the elderly. I was concentrating on the elderly they require simplicity and ease of access. I tried every attempt to crash the app including leaving rogue code to see if that would cause the application to crash.I plan on continuing to develop this app with including a meal tracker. I was able to overcome using Android Studio, knowing nothing of Android Studio.
